Ex 2.6:	Why does it look as it does? Is a learing rate of 0.01 reasonable? What does y < 0 in the lecture
notes mean (p. 43, eq 4.4) ?

Ex 2.7:	There don't seem to be any significant difference between the two cases (shuffled and not suffled).

Ex 2.8:	Is 100 % accuracy reasonable?

Ex 2.9:	Should we be able to do more than 3 augmentations or only 90 degree rotations? What is meant by
the random rotations? Are duplicates ok? Is 100 % accuracy (and 10000 epochs...) reasonable? Why is the
result worse when we have a larger dataset?

Ex 2.15: Since the dataset seems to be random, do we need to shuffle it?

Ex 2.16: How are we supposed to do? Is calculating the ammount of multiplications enough?
